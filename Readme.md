### Digital-Clock 
Digital clocks have become a ubiquitous part of modern life. From alarm clocks to wall clocks to the clocks on our electronic devices, we rely on digital timekeeping to keep us on schedule. But how do digital clocks work, and what are their benefits?
As technology continues to evolve, the future of digital clocks looks bright. One emerging trend is the use of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) in clock displays. OLED displays offer brighter colors, deeper blacks, and lower power consumption than LCD displays.

Another innovation is the use of augmented reality (AR) technology in clock displays. AR clocks can project the time onto any surface, creating a unique and interactive timekeeping experience.
